### Instructions

Your goal is to learn to build real-world simulations using command-line tools. 
If you run the ```--help``` option you will see the follow methods available.

### Tasks

1. Investigate tool operation:

* Run each of the four commands with `--help` i.e. `poker.py info --help`.
* Reflection Question:  What did you learn about how to construct help commands for simulation tools?

2. Explore the `interactive` commands and create a list of five improvements you could make to the interactive simulation to make it more realistic.  

(Optional:  Fork this repository and make your own improved version of the Poker simulator)
